# Control, Optimization and Learning

## About Us
The **Trustworthy Autonomy for Smart Adaptive Systems (TASAS)** group, part of the **Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control (IST)**, conducts fundamental research in the modelling, analysis, and control of uncertain **linear** and **nonlinear dynamical systems**. Our work spans both **model-based** and **data-driven approaches**, as we believe that combining these paradigms is essential for developing safe, efficient, and optimal solutions for complex systems.

We address key challenges in control theory, optimization, and learning, with a focus on:
- **Data-Driven Control Theory**
- **System Identification**
- **Uncertainty Quantification**
- **Optimization**
- **Robust Control**
- **Dynamical Systems Theory**

Our overarching goal is to **foster trustworthy autonomy** by advancing the design of intelligent systems, with a particular emphasis on applications in **sustainable energy systems**, **smart transportation**, and **Industry 4.0**.

## Research Focus
Our research lies at the intersection of **control theory**, **optimization**, and **learning**. We pursue both fundamental and applied research, guided by the following objectives:

- **Model-Based Approaches**: We develop advanced methods for the control and analysis of uncertain dynamical systems, ensuring robustness and efficiency.
- **Data-Based Approaches**: By leveraging machine learning and data-driven techniques, we aim to improve system performance and safety, particularly in scenarios where obtaining precise models is challenging.
- **Trustworthy Autonomy**: We focus on developing systems that are reliable, adaptive, and secure, prioritizing safety and reducing conservatism.
- **Sustainability**: Our research is motivated by the need to design intelligent systems that contribute to a sustainable society, with a strong focus on **energy** and **transportation** systems.
