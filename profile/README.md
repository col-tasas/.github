## About Us
The **Trustworthy Autonomy for Smart Adaptive Systems (TASAS)** group, part of the **Institute for Systems Theory and Automatic Control (IST)**, conducts fundamental research in the modelling, analysis, and control of uncertain **linear** and **nonlinear dynamical systems**. Our work spans both **model-based** and **data-driven approaches**, as we believe that combining these paradigms is essential for developing safe, efficient, and optimal solutions for complex systems.

## Research Focus
Our research lies at the intersection of **control theory**, **optimization**, and **learning**. We pursue both fundamental and applied research, with a focus on:
- **Data-Driven Control Theory**
- **System Identification**
- **Uncertainty Quantification**
- **Optimization**
- **Robust Control**
- **Dynamical Systems Theory**

Our overarching goal is to **foster trustworthy autonomy** by advancing the design of intelligent systems, with a particular emphasis on applications in **sustainable energy systems**, **smart transportation**, and **Industry 4.0**.
